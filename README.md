# Unofficial DDJ-800 Driver Installer for Mac OS Big Sur (10.15)

This is an unofficial installer for the Pioneer DDJ-800 on Mac OS Big sure. This repository is not affiliated with Pioneer. 

## Disclaimer


I had an issue with installing the Pioneeer DDJ-800 Drivers for the recent version of Mac OS, Big Sur. So I repackaged the driver from the official installation package "DDJ-800_M_1.1.0.dmg" and created a custom installer that is compatible with Mac OS 10.15.

I am just a user who bought a DDJ-800 yesterday and I wanted to use it under Big Sur :) Please also see my pioneer forum post where I discribe the installation issue: https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/900001870866-DDJ-800-Driver-Mac-OS-Big-Sur-11-0-1-Installation-Failed

## Installation Guide

1. Download the zip [DDJ-800-Installer.zip here](https://github.com/dstuecken/ddj-800-big-sur-installer/raw/main/DDJ-800-Installer.zip)
2. Unzip DDJ-800-Installer.zip
3. Go to Folder DDJ-800-Installer

## Notes

- Reboot your computer after installation completed
- After rebooting, you might have to run the installer again

**Use at your own risk. I can not guarantee that this installer works on every system!**
